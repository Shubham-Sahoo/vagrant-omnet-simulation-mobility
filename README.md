# Vagrant box for simulation with Omnet++ and SimuLTE

A readme for vagrant box with Omnet++ simulation setup for the project.

## Requirements
Vagrant - Tested with version 2.2.4 (available at: https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)

## Vagrant box setup
In the `\vagrant-omnet-simulation-mobility` folder use: 
```bash
$ vagrant up
```

And wait until the vagrant box setup is complete.

## Using the Omnet++ simulator

To access the box and the simulation environment use the following command while remaining in the `\vagrant-omnet-simulation-mobility` folder:

```bash
$ vagrant ssh
```

This will establish an ssh connection to the box. In there you can access the simulation environment.

### Running a simulation

In order to run simulation scenarios (as they were run within the project) switch to the `Moving1/simulations` folder:

```bash
$ cd Moving1/simulations
```

and use the following command to run an exemplary simulation scenario:

```bash
$ ./run_sim_campaign.sh -c swimMovementFP_ds0_p2_s50-50 -t 1
```

This will run a simulation scenario with the config name "swimMovementFP_ds0_p2_s50-50".

-c argument specifies the scenario's config name. You can find what simulation scenarios are available in the `omnetpp.ini` file.

### Adjusting the movement of UEs

In the simulation we include 3 main types of UE movement - pedestrians (at 1mps), vehicles (at 10mps) and stationary clients. All of these can be adjusted in the `Moving1/simulations/omnetpp.ini` file. In each "Config" section (eg. `[Config swimMovementFP_ds0_p1_s100-0]`) the following can be used to set speed of UEs (exemples):
- ```*.ue[0..39].mobility.speed = 1mps``` Sets movement speed of UEs 0 through 39 to 1 mps (pedestrian)
- ```*.ue[40..79].mobility.speed = 10mps``` Sets movement speed of UEs 40 through 79 to 10 mps (vehicle)
- ```*.ue[*].mobility.speed = 10mps``` Sets movement speed of all UEs to 10 mps (vehicle)

In order to make UEs stationary the following code can be used:
```
*.ue[0..55].mobilityType = "LinearMobility"
*.ue[0..55].mobility.speed = 0mps
```
In this example UEs 0 to 55 will become stationary.

### Other Simulation settings

The following table shows the most relevant parameters used to configure the eNodeB in the simulated scenarios:
